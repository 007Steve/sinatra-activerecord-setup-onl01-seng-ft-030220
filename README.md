# Sinatra Activerecord Setup

## TEACHER OUTLINE
This walkthrough should get students through the mechanics of adding activerecord to a sinatra application. Should mention that this generally isn't necessary as they'll usually start from a template with all of this set up, but it's god to understand the pieces.

should cover:
- activerecord gem
- creating rakefile with activerecord rake tasks
- configuring the database in environment.rb
- Application controller inherits from Sinatra:base
